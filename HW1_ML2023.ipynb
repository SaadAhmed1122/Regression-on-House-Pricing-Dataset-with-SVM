        "You will then be asked to learn various SVM models, in particular:\n",
        "- for each of the kernels ‘linear’, ‘poly’, ‘rbf’, and ‘sigmoid’, you will learn the best model having to choose among various values of some hyperparameters; the choice of hyperparameters must be done with 5-fold cross-validation\n",

        "- learn the best SVM model overall\n",

        "- Note that in each of the above steps you will have to choose the appropriate split of the data (see the first bullet point above)\n",
        "- The code should run without requiring modifications even if some best choice of parameters, changes; for example, you should not pass the best value of hyperparameters \"manually\" (i.e., passing the values as input parameters to the models). The only exception is in the TO DO titled 'ANSWER THE FOLLOWING'\n",
        "- For SVM, since the values to be predicted are all in the thousands of dollars, you will need to always set epsilon=1000\n",
